
# Setting up your server

Before using or developing for Conduit, you need to setup a server!

Download the latest released version of Stream from [here](https://github.com/ConduitMC/Stream/releases)

Once you've done this, run this command to start your server:

```bash
java -jar Stream.jar
```

The first startup will take some time!
