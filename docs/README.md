# Conduit Documentation

Welcome to the official Conduit documentation!

This documentation will cover the main Conduit API exposed to you as a plugin developer. This does *not* contain in-depth information on creating additional mixins along side Conduit.

# What is Conduit?

Conduit is a next-generation Minecraft server software with the goals of creating the most in-depth developer API exposing features never before seen in a Minecraft server.

On top of this, Conduit provides stable, friendly APIs for developers to create plugins on top of.
